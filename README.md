TI3 Combat Analyzer
=================
This is my first attempt at an Android app. My goal is to be able to input your forces and the opponent's forces, and then use the probability of a hit for each ship to compute the losses on the first round of combat. 
A loftier goal will eventually be to guess the best value targets to remove from your forces to maximize the opposing casualties on the second round. 
I would also like it to simulate the second round of combat, either guessing the most likely casualties from your opponent's forces, or allowing you to enter which ships you think he/she would remove.
